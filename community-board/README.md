## Notes

Some challenges I encountered:

- Styling the entire page background consistently. Fixed by adjusting `min-height: 100vh` and aligning colors across `html`, `body`, and `#root`.
- Adding links inside the cards that didnâ€™t break layout. Resolved by wrapping buttons in anchor tags with correct styles.
- Ensuring image sizes stayed uniform across all cards. Solved with `object-fit: cover` and fixed height styles.
- Making the site responsive on mobile. Achieved through grid and flexible width settings.
